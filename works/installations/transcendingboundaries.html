                The installation originates from a mind travel between two friends, one from Beijing and 
                the other from Tripoli. Despite never having physically visited each other's cities, their 
                communication serves as a channel for exploration of each other's cultures. The piece 
                expresses the notion of home and the dreams experience moments of connection, understanding, 
                miscommunication and loss.

                A variety of symbols are employed to represent the diverse encounters one may come across during 
                their travels. Marbles depict individual journeys. As they roll and move, they symbolize the
                paths taken by each person as they navigate through life. The presence of a rolypoly base influences 
                the movement of these marbles, adding an element of unpredictability to their trajectories. 
                This unpredictability reflects the ever-changing nature of travel and highlights the need for adaptability 
                to new circumstances. Furthermore, it emphasizes the qualities of resilience and flexibility required 
                to successfully navigate through unfamiliar territories.
