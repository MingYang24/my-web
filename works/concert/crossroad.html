            <b>Cross Road</b> is a chamber music for ensemble and two Chinese instruments, Sheng
            and Pipa. The piece is inspired from the of sound at the cross road where I was listening
            all kinds of the noise, the takings, the horn, the cellphone ring.... Based on the ideal of
            soundscape by Pierre Scheaffer, the raw material of the piece is the pure imitation from
            the horn sound of automobile and bicycles, which construct the motive of an alternative
            intervals on major second and major third. Moreover, two parts of the piece, the first
            part of the sound from outside---- the sound of the street, mixing the second part of the
            sound inside, represents an experience of the bustle without and the turmoil within.
