                Viruses are grouped on the basis of size and shape, chemical composition and structure of the
                genome, and mode of replication. The shape of different viruses has been at the source of the
                formal organization of the piece. They main section and variation follows any of these shape and
                geometrical organization.

                There are a great number of noises, and techniques creating different type of noises. Noises also
                have different shape and meaning which is personified by specific playing technique on both the
                string and flute.
            </p>
            <p>
                In order to create those noises, the piece is also originated from the Chinese dualism philosophy,
                Xu and Shi (徐 石), each represented by noise and pitches. Xu is played by mute sound on string
                and airy on the flute, and Shi is regular pitches. The combination of those techniques renders the
                piece a mixture of ancient Chinese philosophical conception and a modern connotation.
